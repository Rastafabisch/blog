Remarkable update to Bohemian Coding's [Sketch](http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch) app. It's like Photoshop but with only the UI design related features included:

> We wanted to provide a real alternative to Adobe’s Photoshop or Fireworks and we believe we have succeeded. It’s an ambitious goal for sure but if you’ve been using Photoshop’s vector capabilities combined with Layer Styles, we think we may have something better.
